website-sync
============

Scripts used to hook into post-receive chain of gitolite, such that when an
authorised user pushes certain branches to the repository, the content is
synced to a (remote) webhost.

website-sync is invoked on the gitolite host, by the post-receive hook

website-pull is invoked on the webserver host, via SSH from website-sync

Assumptions
-----------
1) ~/.ssh/config of the gitolite user is setup to forward SSH connections to
   'webhoist' to the correct server.
2)  that website-pull is setup in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to be invoked
    whenever an incoming SSH connection with the relevant SSH key is received 
    (as it uses SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND to retrieve the arguments).
